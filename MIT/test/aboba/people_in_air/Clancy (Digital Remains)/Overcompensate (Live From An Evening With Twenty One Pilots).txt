Welcome back to Trench
Welcome back to Trench
I created this world
To feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Earned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket
Bless your ear holes while you react, acting
Gobsmacked, don't hesitate
To maybe overcompensate
I feel like I was just here, same twitchin' in my eyes
Don't sleep on a boy who can't fall asleep twice
In the same night, and won't hesitate
To maybe overcompensate
I said I fly by the
 dangerous bend symbol (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
And then 
by the time I
 catch in my peripheral (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate 
to maybe overcompensate
Where am I from? I was born right here, just now
Originated right in front of your eyes
If you can't see, I am Clancy, prodigal son
Done running, come up with Josh Dun, wanted dead or alive
So now you pick who you serve, you bow to the masses
Get kicked to the curb for passin' the classes
Half empty, half full, save half for your taxes
Then overtake your former self
I fly by the dangerous
 bend symbol (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate 
to maybe overcompensate
Days feel like a perfect length
I don't need them any longer, 
but for goodness' sake
Do the years seem
 way too short 
for my soul, coraz贸n
Way too short 
for my soul, coraz贸n
 (Ooo)
