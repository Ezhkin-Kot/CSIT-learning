The song 
Trees
… it’s one of the songs we play towards the end of our set, and Josh and I are usually pretty wiped towards the end of our set, so we try to just kinda put everything into it. And Trees is one of those songs for us — Josh and I have talked about it — it almost gives us a second wind, we don’t even know where that energy comes from, you know, we feel like there’s nothing left and then we play trees and something else kicks in. And so it’s one of my favorite songs to play live in front of a room of people who know the song. It’s really fun for us — it’s really fun to hear people sing those words to me, and to themselves, and to the room, and it’s one of those songs where you kinda get to give the show back to the audience and tell them; “This is your show; do what you want with it,” and I’ve seen a lot of crowds run with this song and it’s one of my favorites to play live.
