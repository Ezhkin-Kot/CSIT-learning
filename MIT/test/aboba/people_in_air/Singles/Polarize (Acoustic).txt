Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hidin' all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems
You know where I'm coming from
Though I am running to you
All I feel is deny, deny, denial
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But deny, deny, denial
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hidin' all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems
Polarize is taking your disguises
Separating 'em, splitting 'em up from wrong and right
It's deciding where to die and deciding where to fight
Deny, deny, denial
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But deny, deny, denial
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hidin' all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems
We have problems
We have problems
Domingo en fuego
I think I lost my halo
I don't know where you are
You'll have to come and find me, find me
Domingo en fuego
I think I lost my halo
I don't know where you are
You'll have to come and find me, find me
You'll have to come and find me, find me
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I have problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I have problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I have problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
